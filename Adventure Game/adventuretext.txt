To the east is a massive gorilla!
Would you like to pet the gorilla, sneak past the gorilla, or feed the gorilla a banana?
--> Banana
The gorilla is allergic to bananas! (Achoo!) He pounds you into the ground. You have died. You lose. Would you like to play again?
RESULT: Game Over
--> Sneak
The gorilla notices you! He picks you up, tosses you into the previous room, and locks the door.
RESULT: Back to starting room, can only pick North or West.
--> Pet the gorilla
The gorilla is happy that you pet him! He opens the door to the next room for you.

--> Room B1
There is a massive pit of spikes! A shaky tightrope connects your side to the next. Do you want to jump across the pit, fall into the pit, or walk on the tightrope?
-->Jump 
You jump with all your might and hit your head on the ceiling! You land on the other side, but you are very dizzy.
-->Tightrope
Slowly but surely, you work your way across the tightrope. You make it to the other side safely.
-->Fall
You decide to fall into the pit of your own accord. Game over.

--> Room C1
You arrive in a room with a table full of potions! There is a massive door made out of solid iron. One potion says big, one potion says small, and one potion says poison. Which potion do you drink?
--> Big
You become a giant and start beating the door! But suddenly the door wakes up - it's alive! It responds by killing you.
--> Small
You become the size of an ant! You are able to crawl under the door.
--> Poison
You die, but you become a ghost! You are able to float right out of the dungeon. Congratulations - you win!
